Introduction to Huawei LiteOS
Huawei LiteOS is a lightweight operating system based on real-time kernel developed by Huawei for the Internet of Things. This project belongs to Huawei's IoT operating system Huawei LiteOS source code. The existing basic kernel supports task management, memory management, time management, communication mechanism, interrupt management, queue management, event management, timer and other operating system basic components to better support. Low-power scenarios, support for the tickless mechanism, and support for timer alignment.

At the same time, it provides end-cloud collaboration capabilities, integrates LwM2M, CoAP, mbedtls, and LwIP complete IoT interconnect protocol stacks. On the basis of LwM2M, it provides AgentTiny module. Users only need to pay attention to their own applications without paying attention to LwM2M implementation details. The agentTiny encapsulated interface can be used to quickly and securely connect to the cloud platform.

Since the release of the open source community, Huawei LiteOS has built around the NB-IoT IoT market from technology, ecology, solutions, commercial support and other multi-dimensional enabling partners to build an open source IoT ecosystem. Currently, 30+ MCUs and solutions have been aggregated. Partners, jointly launched a number of open source development kits and industry solutions to help customers in many industries to quickly launch IoT terminals and services, including customers such as meter reading, parking, street lighting, environmental protection, shared bicycles, logistics, etc. Provide a "one-stop" complete software platform to effectively lower the development threshold and shorten the development cycle.
